def convolve_grayscale_same(images, kernel):
    """ performs a same convolution on grayscale images:
args:
    images: np.ndarr w/ shape (m, h, w, c) containing multiple images
        m is the number of images
        h is the height in pixels of the images
        w is the width in pixels of the images
        c is the number of channels in the image
    kernels: npy.ndarr w/ shape (kh, kw, c, nc) containin the kernels
        kh is the height of a kernel
        kw is the width of a kernel
        nc is the number of kernels
if necessary, the image should be padded with 0â€™s
Returns: a numpy.ndarray containing the convolved images"""
