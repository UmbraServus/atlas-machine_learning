autoencoders

0-vanilla.py - Vanilla Autoencoder that simply encodes and decodes in one model as an autoencoder. returns encoder, decoder, autoencoder.

1-sparse.py - similar to autoencoder but with regularization to learn more unique features on the reconstruction by dropping out some of the nodes in the encoding.

2-convolutional - convolutional autoencoder
