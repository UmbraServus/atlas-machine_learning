def viterbi(Observation, Emission, Transition, Initial):
    """
    Calculates the most likely sequence of hidden states for a hidden Markov
    model.

    Parameters:
    Observation (numpy.ndarray): Array of shape (T,) that contains the index
                                 of the observation. T is the number of
                                 observations.
    Emission (numpy.ndarray): Array of shape (N, M) containing the emission
                              probability of a specific observation given a
                              hidden state. Emission[i, j] is the probability
                              of observing j given the hidden state i. N is
                              the number of hidden states, and M is the number
                              of all possible observations.
    Transition (numpy.ndarray): 2D array of shape (N, N) containing the
                                transition probabilities. Transition[i, j] is
                                the probability of transitioning from the
                                hidden state i to j.
    Initial (numpy.ndarray): Array of shape (N, 1) containing the probability
                             of starting in a particular hidden state.

    Returns:
    path (list): List of length T containing the most likely sequence of
                 hidden states.
    P (float): Probability of obtaining the path sequence.
    None, None: On failure.

    # Pseudo code:
    # 1. Initialize variables:
    #    - T: number of observations
    #    - N: number of hidden states
    #  a  - Initialize a matrix to store the highest probability of any path
    #      that reaches each state at time t.
    #    - Initialize a matrix to store the backpointers to reconstruct the
    #      path.

    # 2. Initialization step:
    #    - For each state, calculate the initial probability of starting in
    #      that state and observing the first observation.

    # 3. Recursion step:
    #    - For each observation from 1 to T-1:
    #        - For each state:
    #            - Calculate the maximum probability of reaching that state
    #              from any previous state.
    #            - Store the backpointer to the state that maximizes the
    #              probability.

    # 4. Termination step:
    #    - Identify the final state with the highest probability.
    #    - Backtrack through the backpointers to reconstruct the most likely
    #      sequence of hidden states.

    # 5. Return the most likely sequence of hidden states and the probability
    #    of that sequence.
