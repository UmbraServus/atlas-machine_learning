def baum_welch(Observations, Transition, Emission, Initial, iterations=1000):
    """
    Performs the Baum-Welch algorithm for a hidden markov model.

    Parameters:
    - Observations (numpy.ndarray): shape (T,) that contains the index of the
      observation
        - T is the number of observations
    - Transition (numpy.ndarray): shape (M, M) that contains the initialized
      transition probabilities
        - M is the number of hidden states
    - Emission (numpy.ndarray): shape (M, N) that contains the initialized
      emission probabilities
        - N is the number of output states
    - Initial (numpy.ndarray): shape (M, 1) that contains the initialized
      starting probabilities
    - iterations (int): the number of times expectation-maximization should be
      performed

    Returns:
    - Transition (numpy.ndarray): the converged transition probabilities
    - Emission (numpy.ndarray): the converged emission probabilities
    - or (None, None) on failure

    # Pseudo code:
    # 1. Initialize variables
    # 2. Loop for the specified number of iterations
    #    a. E-step: Calculate the forward and backward probabilities
    #    b. M-step: Update the transition and emission probabilities
    # 3. Check for convergence
    # 4. Return the updated Transition and Emission matrices

    # Actual implementation goes here
